# Pandas notebooks

During a Python for Data Journalists MOOC led by Ben Welsh, LA Times data editor, and organised by the Knight Centre for Journalism at the University of Texas at Austin, I analysed data on political campaign funding in California. I used pandas library, Jupyter notebook and the techniques learnt on the course to find new leads in the data (since the data was not new, the leads were reported on before in the US, but I discovered them independently).
